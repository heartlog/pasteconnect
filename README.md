password = "*******"
api_key = "123456abcdefg"
# Define Client
pastebin = PasteConn(username, password, api_key)
```
Alternatively, you can initialize with [predefined environment variables](https://rentry.co/setenv)

print(result)  # Response: '[heartlog] is Valid Account. User key : "user_key"'
```

## Authentication

#### `pastebin.auth()`
![dash](https://img.shields.io/badge/-----grey)

```py
result = pastebin.auth()
print(result)  # Response: "user_key"
```

![title](https://img.shields.io/badge/title-blue)
![content](https://img.shields.io/badge/content-purple)

```py
# 0 : public | 1 : unlisted | 2 : private
privacy = 1 # (default - private)
title = "Title of paste"

pastebin.create_paste(title, content, privacy=1)
```

#### `pastebin.delete_paste(url)`
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/url-blue)
